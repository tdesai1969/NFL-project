## NFL-Project
# Project Description Outline:
What does it mean when they say a player’s career was cut short? (BoxPlot)
What is the mean length and standard deviation of the seasons played for a set of offense players?
What criteria would be best used to predict a future Hall of Fame candidate? (* Players)

Dataset – 30 years of data - Data for 4 NFL positions
Focusing on seasons QB, TE, WR, RB over all NFL teams
Career length by season 
Chart mean and standard deviate of the career length
Datapoints

The Pro Football reference site was used as it was the largest, most concise and single source of information that we could identify.

# The data exploration and cleanup process
We identified many online sources; however, after quality analyses they were rejected due to missing or incorrect data.
There was a learning curve due to the unfamiliar nature of football jargon, positions and statistical abbreviations used frequently in the datasets.  Understanding the data was a key driver for all team members and ultimately expedited the cleanup process.

# The analysis process
Compared and contrast a set of current offensive players (QB, TE, WR, RB) against the records of Hall of Fame players.  
This analytical process narrowed down the criteria to 3 key areas: yards gained, seasons played and total career touchdowns.
Created a series of scatter plots to visualize which of the current players are on target to be potentially inducted into the Hall of Fame. Layered the Hall of Fame players on top of those current player to illustrate if they were nearing the criteria.
